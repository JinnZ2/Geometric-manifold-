# falsifier-survey

Filed 2026-09-05; instructions pending. Nothing here has been audited,
re-run or edited. This README is the only file in the folder not from the
drop or derived from it by the filter stated below.

## Where this came from

A two-run falsifier survey arrived as one zip and was first filed whole in
`JinnZ2/Simulators` (commit `5e81b9d`, `falsifier-survey/`). Run 1 covered
Simulators. **Run 2 covered this repository and `Geometric-to-Binary-Computational-Bridge` in one report
and one cell file.** This folder is the Geometric-manifold- share of Run 2, split out by
the `repo` field every Run 2 record carries (`gm`). The combined
delivered files are recoverable at that Simulators commit; their hashes are
below so the split can be checked.

## Contents

```
falsifier_survey_report_run2.md   VERBATIM. Covers both repos; the same
                                  bytes sit in Geometric-to-Binary-Computational-Bridge/falsifier-survey/.

survey2/batches2/                 VERBATIM. This repo's coder batch(es)
                                  (gm) and the hit slice each
                                  coder received; assign.json (all three
                                  batches, both repos) and validate2.py
                                  (both repos, absolute /mnt/agents paths)
                                  are the delivered combined files, unedited.

## Counts for this repo, as delivered

109 cells: MEASURED 97, MISSING 4, SCOPE-DIFFERENT 1, UNKNOWN 7.
The report's own per-repo line is the authority; this line is the filter's
count and should match it.

## Provenance notes, not findings

- Seven unit names occur in both repos (`docs`, `atlas`, `experiments`,
  `tests`, `scripts`, `bridges`, `(repo root)`), so the split keys on the
  `repo` field and never on the unit name.
- The report dates its run 2026-09-05 against a fresh clone of HEAD and
  records no commit.
- Run 2 includes `docs/` as a survey unit; Run 1 excluded it.
- Coding was from reading, not execution, per the Run 1 report's own
  limitations section; Run 2 states an identical protocol.
